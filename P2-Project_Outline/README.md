## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    My application will allow a user to search through different websites and compare product prices to a specific search the user inputs in order to help them find the best price. 
This website will allow the user too login in order to save the product they want in their own private list to refer back too. 
    This will help the user to save time and confusion instead of having to search multiple websites.Further, by allowing the user to save a product they have searched for they can then go back and buy that product at a later time and not have to search again which will again save them time. 
The user saved items will also be updated for the product with the best price as item pricing fluctuates which allows a user to know they are always getting the best deal.
### Features
    User Login: Users will be able to create and account to log in to the application. 
    Search: Users will be able to search diffent shopping compaines in order too find the best priced item of choice.
    Wish List: Each user will have a wish list page where they can eihter add or delete an searched item for refrence.

### What I'll Have to Learn
    I need to learn how to pull data from multiple public API's to use in my application. I am still unsure what this will include as I am unsure if I need to create my own Rest API or if I need to come up with a way to use scraping in order to collect the informaiton I need from these public API's. I may also learning some more JavaScript in order to make my front end more interactive for the user.
